if sensor goes through function A, all entity are outputs, but also is the group of entities the senesor? So A_OUT == X here? i,e, in table 6a, SENSOR would have first row A_out.... down until function B?

Heres the thing:
Robinson: "The entities listed in a given sensor are those that can be derived from that sensor's data. Theta1 and Theta2 can be derived from s, so you only need to store s in that particular sensor. That's what is done in the sheaf in the paper.  Perhaps this isn't the best implementation choice as far as automation goes?"

```{r}
#Now let's figure out how to handle creating the thetas:
## Either: Create thetas from the functions that output the coordinates, and shift them to global variables inside of the original stalk

If you have the same set of entities you have the same sensors:


```{r}
#for (i in SixB$DMap){
#  do.call(i, enter)
#}

#do.call(A, enter)

#alter > ncol(SixB)
```



Assignment Table;
GOAL!

```{r}
#Assignment <- as.data.frame(sensor = c(), value = c())
#flight plan = U1

Table1 <- read.csv("Assignment2.csv")

Table1 %>%
  select(Key, entity, Case1) %>% #selecting vars for ...
  group_by(Key) %>% #grouping by key for ...
  rename(value = Case1)%>% #renaming case1 to value for test.
  nest(entity = entity, value = value) -> andrea


#%>%
#  nest(StalkValue = c(entity, value))-> Assignment 


# andrea suggested I not use the nested table, bc of how it was presenting, she suggested two different columns. 
  
  



```

```{r}

SixB %>%
  left_join(andrea, by = c(SSource = "Key")) -> SixB2 # or andrea/Assigmnt

SixB2 %>%

# not a dim prob. 
#this should run when everything else works...
