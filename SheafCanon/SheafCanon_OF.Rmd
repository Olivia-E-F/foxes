What should be done with variables outside of the assignment table that we need? Constraints for functions not in any assignment table...

## Restriction Functions:
Page 214: s_x, s_y are coordinates of an object detected in the satellite image, r_1x, r_1y are coordinates of the first RDF sensor and r_2x, r_2y are coordinates of the second RDF sensor.

                           "U4", "X", "U1", "U2", "U3", "U4", "U5", "V1", "V2", "V3"),

## Consistency Radius: 

radius=ish sd/var of stalkoutputs/ diameter of stalkoutputs. Coord. comp
Unnest, aggregate along all of the columns. 
Put the STD together, remember units are diff
chi square, norm. var. 
Ideally have user supply aggregation function. 

process below should be a specific function, so to optimize consistency radius. best consistency radius function like lm() taking consistency radius function.

$$d_U(x,y) = \sqrt{\sum_{i \in columns} \frac{A_i}{ncol} | x_i - y_i| ^2}$$
A_i is the unit conversion.

Unit Conversions:; note- We converted everything to radians. 

```{r, Units}
UnitScale <- tibble(variable = c("x", "y", "z", "v_x", "v_y", "t", "Theta1", "Theta2", "s_x", "s_y"),
                    scale = c(1*110.567*cos(43*pi/180), 1*110.567, 1/1000, 1, 1, 1, pi/180, pi/180, 1*110.567*cos(43*pi/180), 1*110.567)) # Scaling units

SensorScale <- FinSheaf %>% count(dest) # Scaling Sensors, by n?
```

```
X to U1, we want X-> U2, U2 -> U1



I want to store a pair of edges for each new composition and then nest them and then map them. 



# Questions:

From PNLL+Robinson paper

Joslyn, Cliff A., et al. “A Sheaf Theoretical Approach to Uncertainty Quantification of Heterogeneous Geolocation Information.” Sensors (Basel, Switzerland), vol. 20, no. 12, MDPI, 2020, p. 3418–, https://doi.org/10.3390/s20123418.

The consistency radius (more fully developed by Robinson [2] in later work) provides a native global measure of the uncertainty among the sensors present in any reading. Beyond that, the consistency filtration provides a detailed breakdown of the contributions of particular sensors and sensor combinations to that overall uncertainty.

Pseudometric: function that takes in 2 elements of a set, produces a non-negative real number.
d_u is a pseudometric. 

Maximum aggregation variant:
Note: \mathcal{} marking sheaves and collections of subsets. :)
Supremum vs Max:
- Least of upper bounds
vs
- The biggest one
-1/x x>0, always a negative number. Any positive is an upper bound. Least of upper bounds is zero. SUP = 0, Max = ND.
In practice, MAX.

$$c_{\mathcal{S}}(a) := \sup_{U \subseteq V \in \mathcal{T}} \; d_U((\mathcal{S}(U \subseteq V)) a(V), a(U))$$
^ Sensitive to outliers. Better for theorem proving.
d_U is a function/pseudometric that produces real number. 

Norm: input element of set, produces non-negative real number.

Stalk outputs: $\mathcal{S}(U \subseteq V)) a(V)$

Lest squares aggregation variant:
$$c_{\mathcal{S}}(a) := \sqrt{\sum_{U \subseteq V \in \mathcal{T}} \; d_u((\mathcal{S}(U \subseteq V)) a(V), a(U))^2}$$
Least squares aggregation variant of consistency:: I.e consistency radius per “A Sheaf Theoretical Approach to Uncertainty...”

sqrt(
  sum(
    (stalkoutput-assignment_case)^2
  )
)

This method is less sensitive to outliers than taking the supremum of the distances between stalkoutput and assignments.

Every norm on $\mathbb{R}^n$ has an associated consistency radius. 

Small means min. disagreement among observations, large some sensors disagree.

Per Pysheaf: Computes the error between the data assignments and extended assignments on the sheaf
      :param numpyNormType: Optional, how the errors across the sheaf are combined.
      default is take maximum error.
      :param cellStartIndices: Optional, which cells may start the data flowed into 
      this cell
      :returns: Error between the data assignments and extended assignments on the 
      sheaf

norm(differences in assignment?)

Testing variances:

have pre-consistency radii , un-group and aggregate all rads to get consistency radius.
ends with: for each stalk you have a radius, then aggregate them, max, sum of squares.
