foxesdata <- read_csv("test.csv", 
    col_names = c("time", "x", "y", "name", "signal_strength", "bearing"))

```

Sensor $A$, Metric space $S1$ is the unit circle, 
The signal report is a pseudometric space $D_A$, depending on the sensor $A$. 

The sensor $A$ produces reports through a continuous measurement function
MA: $R2$ X $CF$ X $R2$ X $CA$ -> $D_A$,
depending on fox transmitter location (in the plane),
the fox transmitter equipment settings CF (such as transmitter power and antenna orientation),
the receiver location in the plane, and the receiver equipment settings CA (such as antenna orientation).

- Our sensor data will be drawn from a parameterized distribution SA, in which the noise level sigma is taken as a parameter.

- Received Signal Strength indication (RSSI) measures the amount of power absorbed by its antenna from the fox transmitter. 


## Sensors:

* Sensor 1 posiiton (x,y), denoted $\textbf{B1};$ 
* Receiver 1 posiiton (x',y'), denoted $\textbf{B1prime};$
* Sensor 2 posiiton (x,y), denoted $\textbf{B2};$
* Receiver 2 posiiton (x',y'), denoted $\textbf{B2prime};$
* Sensor 3 posiiton (x,y), denoted $\textbf{R3};$
* Receiver 3 posiiton (x',y'), denoted $\textbf{R3prime};$
* Sensor 4 posiiton (x,y), denoted $\textbf{R4};$
* Receiver 4 posiiton (x',y'), denoted $\textbf{R4prime};$

where (x,y) is the transmitter location and (x',y') is the receiver location.

# Functions

## ID Functions:
There are 10 ID functions.

B1: Sensor 1 position and bearing.  
B1': Fox position, Sensor 1 position.

```{r Functions ID B1 Transmitter}
# Sensor 1
ID_B1 <- function(stalk){
  stalk %>%
    select(c(s1x, s1y, bearing))
}

```

```{r Functions ID B1 Receiver}
# Sensor 1'
ID_B1prime <- function(stalk){
   stalk %>%
    select(c(foxx, foxy, s1x, s1y))
}
```

B2: Sensor 2 position and bearing.  
B2': Fox position, Sensor 2 position.

```{r Functions ID B2 Transmitter}
# Sensor 2
ID_B2 <- function(stalk){
  stalk %>%
    select(c(s2x, s2y, bearing))
}
```

```{r Functions ID B2 Receiver}
# Sensor 2'
ID_B2prime <- function(stalk){
  stalk %>%
    select(c(foxx, foxy, s2x, s2y))
}
```

R3: Sensor 3 position and RSSI.  
R3': Fox position and power, Sensor 3 position. 

```{r Functions ID R3 Transmitter}
# Sensor 3
ID_R3 <- function(stalk){
  stalk %>%
    select(c(s3x, s3y, rssi))
}
```

```{r Functions ID R3 Receiver}
# Sensor 3'
ID_R3prime <- function(stalk){
  stalk %>%
    select(c(foxx, foxy, power, s3x, s3y))
}
```

R4: Sensor 4 position and RSSI.  
R4': Fox position and power, Sensor 4 position.

```{r Functions ID R4 Transmitter}
# Sensor 4
ID_R4 <- function(stalk){
  stalk %>%
    select(c(s4x, s4y, rssi))
}
```

```{r Functions ID R4 Receiver}
# Sensor 4'
ID_R4prime <- function(stalk){
  stalk %>%
    select(c(foxx, foxy, power, s4x, s4y))
}
```

F: Fox position.  
F': Fox position, transmit power.
 
```{r Functions ID F Transmitter}
# Fox Position
ID_F <- function(stalk){
  stalk %>%
    select(c(foxx, foxy))
}
```

```{r Functions ID F Receiver}
# Fox Position
ID_Fprime <- function(stalk){
  stalk %>%
    select(c(foxx, foxy, power))
}
```


## Maps:
9 in total; 9 arrows in the diagram

Other, M:Bearing and Power
The bearing functions transform the (X,Y) location to compass bearing in degree. Output is a single number.
The power functions output fox transmitter power from transmitter location (X,Y) and receiver location (X',Y').
