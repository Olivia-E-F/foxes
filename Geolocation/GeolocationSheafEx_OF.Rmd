Sensors:

* The GPS reading on the Bear Collar, denoted $\textbf{G};$
* The Radio VHF Device receiver, denoted $\textbf{R};$
* The Text report, denoted $\textbf{T};$ and
* The Vehicle GPS, denoted $\textbf{V}.$


Where $\textbf{G}$ and $\textbf{R}$ trace location of the bear, and $\textbf{R}$, $\textbf{T}$, and $\textbf{V}$ trace the location of the researcher.

$\textbf{U = \{V, R, T, G\}}$ base sensor set ASC $\Delta$, representing the tracking sensor network, contains the face denoted $H = \{V, R, T \}$ and all nine faces are  
$\Delta$ = { {V, R, T},  
{V, T}, {R, T}, {V, R},  
{R, G}, {V}, {R}, {T}, {G} }

![Table 1](GeoTable1.png)

With Pairwise interactions X, Y, and Z = {V, T,}, {V, R}, and {R, T} respectively.  

![Table 2](GeoTable2.png)

To convert the text descriptions we use Google Maps API [63] and to convert the (lat, long, ft) readings, coming from the vehicle, we use the Python open source package utm 0.4.1 [64].

$$\phi: \mathbb{R}^5 \to \mathbb{R}^5, \phi((x, y, z, r, \theta)^T) = (x, y, z, r cos(\theta), rsin(\theta))^T  $$

# UPDATE MODEL:
X, Z, H -> R2. Z coord not available from openstreet text. Now X, Z, H =  (x, y).

# \textbf{Step 1:}
## Restriction Functions:


IDs \textbf{ID function return itself, refer to image for components.}

Since the pairwise relations all share UTM coordinates, only ID mappings are needed among them -- up to the three-way H face.

In total there are 12 ID functions. 

```{r Functions Identity V}
ID_V <- function(stalk){
  stalk %>%
    select(c(x, y, z))
}
```

```{r Functions Identity T}
ID_T <- function(stalk){
  stalk %>%
    select(c(Text))
}
```

```{r Functions Identity R}
ID_R <- function(stalk){
  stalk %>%
    select(c(x, y, z, r, theta))
}
```

```{r Functions Identity G}
ID_G <- function(stalk){
  stalk %>%
    select(c(x, y, z))
}
```

```{r Functions Identity X}
ID_X <- function(stalk){
  stalk %>%
    select(c(x, y))
}
```

```{r Functions Identity Y}
ID_Y <- function(stalk){
  stalk %>%
    select(c(x, y, z))
}
```

```{r Functions Identity Z}
ID_Z <- function(stalk){
  stalk %>%
    select(c(x, y))
}
```

```{r Functions Identity B}
ID_B <- function(stalk){
  stalk %>%
    select(c(x, y))
}
```

```{r Functions Identity H}
ID_H <- function(stalk){
  stalk %>%
    select(c(x, y)) 
}
```

```{r Functions Identity YH}
ID_YH <- function(stalk){
  stalk %>%
    select(c(x, y)) 
}
```

```{r Functions Identity ZH}
ID_ZH <- function(stalk){
  stalk %>%
    select(c(x, y)) 
}
```

```{r Functions Identity XH}
ID_XH <- function(stalk){
  stalk %>%
    select(c(x, y)) 
}
```

UTM 0.4.1 functions

For reference on the string specification being out of date:
https://inbo.github.io/tutorials/tutorials/spatial_crs_coding/

```{r}
UTM_VX <- function(stalk){
  coordsNA <- c() # init matrix
  coordsNA$x <- as.numeric(stalk$long) #base r matrix gets info from order inputted not names
  coordsNA$y <- as.numeric(stalk$lat)
  SpatialPoints(coordsNA, proj4string = CRS("+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84")) -> llcoords # makes s4
  spTransform(llcoords, CRS("+proj=utm +zone=17 +datum=WGS84 +units=m")) -> tcoords
  tibble(x = tcoords$x, y = tcoords$y, z = stalk$z*0.3048)
} 
```

```{r}
UTM_VY <- function(stalk){
  coordsNA <- c() # init matrix
  coordsNA$x <- as.numeric(stalk$long) #base r matrix gets info from order inputted not names
  coordsNA$y <- as.numeric(stalk$lat)
  SpatialPoints(coordsNA, proj4string = CRS("+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84")) -> llcoords # makes s4
  spTransform(llcoords, CRS("+proj=utm +zone=17 +datum=WGS84 +units=m")) -> tcoords
  tibble(x = tcoords$x, y = tcoords$y, z = stalk$z*0.3048)
}
```

Google Maps -> OpenStreetMap Data.
For a cost free solution, I used OpenStreetMap data instead of Google Maps API. 

Feed OpenStreetMap a text, get lat long, turn to UTM:

```{r}
textcoords <- function(stalk, inputcity){ # take in the stalk + the input city in quotes
  
  stalk %>%
    select(Text) -> string
  
# Need to get names of the roads only. First select the street name. 
# For example, Woodly Road. Second, select only the name, Woodly. 
  
  string %>%
    str_extract_all('([\\w]*?\\S+).(Rd|Road|St|Hwy|Highway|Dr|Ln|Lane|Ct|Court|Ave|Pl)') %>% 
    unlist()%>%
    str_extract_all('\\b(?!(Rd|Road|St|Hwy|Highway|Dr|Ln|Lane|Ct|Court|Ave|Pl)\\b)\\w+') -> names
  
  #readline(prompt = "Enter City in Quotes: ") -> inputcity
  print(inputcity) # checkpt
  city <- getbb(inputcity) # get bounding box for city.
  #head(city) #checkpt
  
# Check database for the road. get sf object.
  citystreets <- city %>%
    opq() %>%
    add_osm_feature("highway", c("motorway", "primary", "secondary", "tertiary", "residential","living_street","unclassified", "service", "footway")) %>%
    osmdata_sf()
  
  print(citystreets) #checkpt, non-zero?

  #find coordinates of the first road
  tibble(name = citystreets$osm_lines$name, geometry = citystreets$osm_lines$geometry) %>% # geometries are linestring objects
    filter(grepl(names[[1]], name)) %>%
    mutate(points = map(geometry, ~st_coordinates(.) %>% as.data.frame())) %>% # retrieve coordinates in matrix form
    unnest(points)-> geompoints_rd1 # coords to match
  print(geompoints_rd1)
  
  # find coordinates of the second road
  tibble(name = citystreets$osm_lines$name, geometry = citystreets$osm_lines$geometry) %>%
    filter(grepl(names[[2]], name)) %>%
    mutate(points = map(geometry, ~st_coordinates(.) %>% as.data.frame())) %>%
    unnest(points)-> geompoints_rd2 # coords to match 
  print(geompoints_rd2)
  
  # Hope that they intersect! Inner join on the intersection, which gives lat and long of street intersection. 
  inner_join(geompoints_rd1, geompoints_rd2, by = c(X = "X", Y = "Y"))%>% 
    select(X, Y) %>% head(1) %>%
    transmute(lat= Y, long = X)
}

# base test:
stalk <- data.frame(Text = c("Intersection at Victoria Rd and Meadow Rd"))
stalk2 <- data.frame(Text = c("Intersection of Wood Ave and Parker Road"))
# Further testing should be done with numbered streets

textcoords(stalk, "Asheville")
```

```{r}
OSM_TX <- function(stalk){
  stalk %>% 
    textcoords("Asheville") %>% # pipe in stalk, then add input city, here from the paper we are in Asheville.
    UTM_VX()
}

```


```{r}
OSM_TZ <- function(stalk){
    stalk %>% 
    textcoords("Asheville") %>%
    UTM_VX()
}
```

$pr_{x-y}$: Labels of the form prx-y are projections of the corresponding coordinates (also presentable as binary matrices of the appropriate form).

$pr_{1-2}$ 

```{r}
PRgb_1_2 <- function(stalk){
  stalk %>%
    select(c(x, y)) 
}
```

$pr_{1-3}$
```{r}
PRry_1_3 <- function(stalk){
  stalk %>%
    select(c(x, y, z))
}
```

```{r}
PRrz_1_3 <- function(stalk){
  stalk %>%
    select(c(x, y)) 
}
```

"Finally, the restriction from R up to B is the composition of the polar conversion of the final two components with the projection on the first two to predict the bear
position from the radiocollar GPS, bearing, and range."  

$$\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix} \circ
\phi:(x, y, z, r cos(\theta), rsin(\theta))^T  $$  


```{r Functions phi_RB}
phi_RB <- function(stalk){
  stalk %>%
    mutate(x = x+r*sin(theta*pi/180), y = y+r*cos(theta*pi/180)) %>%
    select(c(x, y))
}
```


# \textbf{Step 2:}

## Assignment Table:  
Global section inputs for case 1:
![Global Section 1](GeoGlobalSect1.png)

```{r}
assignment <- read.csv("GeoAssignmentTable.csv") 
assignment
```

## MODEL:

```{r}
model <- tibble(map = c(ID_V, ID_T, ID_R, ID_G, ID_X, ID_Y, ID_Z, ID_B, ID_H, UTM_VX, UTM_VY,phi_RB,PRgb_1_2, PRry_1_3, PRrz_1_3, ID_YH, ID_ZH, ID_XH, OSM_TZ, OSM_TX),
                    source = c("V", "T", "R", "G", "X", "Y", "Z", "B", "H", "V", "V", "R", "G", "R", "R", "Y", "Z", "X", "T", "T"), #key == source
                    dest =   c("V", "T", "R", "G", "X", "Y", "Z", "B", "H", "X", "Y", "B", "B", "Y", "Z", "H", "H", "H", "Z", "X"))

as.data.frame(model) -> model #20x11
# Checked all sources and dests match functions √
```

Attach model to table, and execute functions to make full sheaf model with outputs:

```{r}
assignment %>%
  select(variable, case1, source) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = variable, values_from = case1) %>%
  mutate(across(c(x, y, z, lat, long, theta, r), as.numeric))%>% # needed to transform from chr to dbl. 
  right_join(model, by = c(source = "source")) %>%
  nest(stalkinput = 2:9) %>%
  mutate(stalkoutput = map2(.x= map, .y = stalkinput, .f = exec)) -> sheaf # These were all global sections, should have cons.rad of 0

assignment %>%
  select(variable, case2, source)%>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = variable, values_from = case2)%>%
  mutate(across(c(x, y, z, lat, long, theta, r), as.numeric))%>% # needed to transform from chr to dbl. 
  right_join(model, by = c(source = "source")) %>%
  nest(stalkinput = 2:9) %>%
  mutate(stalkoutput = map2(.x= map, .y = stalkinput, .f = exec)) -> sheaf2
# This one should not have cons.rad of 0

#Both cases work! Problem lies in connection for osmdata sometimes it doesnt run... not my problem.
```


# transitive closure:

```{r}
verticies <- as.character(unique(sheaf$dest))
graph <- tibble(source=factor(sheaf$source,levels=verticies),
                 destination=factor(sheaf$dest,levels=verticies))

#%>%
  #filter(source != destination) -> graph

transitive_closure <- function(graph){
  
  graph %>%
    mutate(temp=1)%>% 
    pivot_wider(names_from=destination,
                values_from=temp,
                values_fill=0L, #?
                id_expand = TRUE,  # The _expand options use the factor levels
                names_expand = TRUE) -> incidence_tib
  incidence_tib$source -> source
  incidence_tib %>%
    select(!source)%>%
    as.matrix()-> incidence_matrix
  diag(incidence_matrix) <- 0
  incidence_matrix -> incidence_matrix_updated
  while(norm(incidence_matrix_updated) > 1e-3){
    incidence_matrix %*% incidence_matrix_updated -> incidence_matrix_updated
    
    incidence_matrix_updated %>%

$$d_U(x,y) = \sqrt{\sum_{i \in columns} \frac{A_i}{ncol} | x_i - y_i| ^2}$$
A is the unit conversion.

We converted everything to radians. 

Unit Conversions


```{r}

#scale = c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1))
                    #           long, lat, ft,     lat, long,     deg,    text,meters
                      scale = c(1, 1, 1/0.3048, 1, 1, pi/180, 1, 1)) # Scaling units
# UTM IS IN METESR, SO DONT CHANGE THOSE LAT LONGS....

SensorScale <- sheaf %>% count(dest) # Scaling Sensors, by n?
